SkillHub is a self-hosted platform that gives teams a private,
governed place to share agent skills. Publish a skill package, push
it to a namespace, and let others find it through search or
install it via CLI. Built for on-premise deployment behind your
firewall, with the same polish you'd expect from a public registry.

## Documentation

- 📖 **[User Guide](https://iflytek.github.io/skillhub/)** — Skill publishing, search, CLI usage and other user guides
- 🛠️ **[Developer Docs](https://zread.ai/iflytek/skillhub)** — Architecture, API reference, local development, deployment and operations

## Highlights

- **Self-Hosted & Private** — Deploy on your own infrastructure.
  Keep proprietary skills behind your firewall with full data
  sovereignty. One `make dev-all` command to get running locally.
- **Publish & Version** — Upload agent skill packages with semantic
  versioning, custom tags (`beta`, `stable`), and automatic
  `latest` tracking.
- **Discover** — Full-text search for published skills with
  namespace-aware visibility rules, so users only see what
  they're authorized to access.
- **Team Namespaces** — Organize skills under team or global scopes.
  Each namespace has its own members, roles (Owner / Admin /
  Member), and publishing policies.
- **Review & Governance** — Team admins review within their namespace;
  platform admins gate promotions to the global scope.
- **Password Auth** — Username/password login with JWT-based API
  access and a bootstrap admin for local setup.
- **CLI-First** — Native REST API plus a compatibility layer for
  existing ClawHub-style registry clients. Native CLI APIs are the
  primary supported path while protocol compatibility continues to
  expand.
- **Local Storage** — Skill packages are stored on the local
  filesystem for both development and Docker deployment.
- **Internationalization** — Multi-language support with i18next.

## Quick Start

Start the full local stack with:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/skillhub-runtime
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up
```

The default command pulls the `latest` stable release images. Use `--version edge` if you want the newest build from `main`.

**Configure public URL (recommended for production):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up --public-url https://skillhub.your-company.com
```

The `--public-url` parameter sets the public access URL for your SkillHub instance. This ensures:
- CLI install commands show the correct registry URL
- Agent setup instructions display the correct skill.md URL
- Shared links and setup instructions use the correct base URL

**For users in China (Aliyun mirror):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up --aliyun --public-url https://skillhub.your-company.com
```

If deployment runs into problems, clear the existing runtime home and retry.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Make

### Local Development

```bash
make dev-all
```

Then open:

- Web UI: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8080`

`make dev-all` starts PostgreSQL in Docker, builds the backend binary to
`./.dev/skillhub-server`, and runs the backend directly on your machine.
Local development uses the same username/password + JWT flow as the Go backend.

The local bootstrap admin is enabled by default:

- username: `admin`
- password: `ChangeMe!2026`
- To disable it, set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_ENABLED=false` before starting the backend.

Stop everything with:

```bash
make dev-all-down
```

Reset local dependencies and start from a clean slate with:

```bash
make dev-all-reset
```

Run `make help` to see all available commands.

Useful backend commands:

```bash
make test
make test-backend
make build-go-backend
make build-dev-server
make dev-server
```

For the full development workflow (local dev → staging → PR), see [docs/dev-workflow.md](docs/dev-workflow.md).

### Container Runtime

Published runtime images are built by GitHub Actions and pushed to GHCR.
This is the supported path for anyone who wants a ready-to-use local
environment without building the backend or frontend on their machine.
Published images target both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

**Quick deployment with curl:**

```bash
# Default (GHCR images)
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up --public-url https://skillhub.your-company.com

# Aliyun mirror (recommended for users in China)
curl -fsSL https://imageless.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up --aliyun --public-url https://skillhub.your-company.com
```

**Deployment parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--public-url <url>` | Public access URL (recommended) | `--public-url https://skill.example.com` |
| `--version <tag>` | Specific image tag | `--version v0.2.0` |
| `--aliyun` | Use Aliyun mirror (China) | `--aliyun` |
| `--home <dir>` | Runtime directory | `--home /opt/skillhub` |
> **Important**: Configure `--public-url` for production deployments to ensure CLI install commands and Agent setup instructions display the correct URLs.

**Manual deployment:**

1. Copy the runtime environment template.
2. Pick an image tag.
3. Start the stack with Docker Compose.

```bash
cp .env.release.example .env.release
```

Recommended image tags:

- `SKILLHUB_VERSION=edge` for the latest `main` build
- `SKILLHUB_VERSION=vX.Y.Z` for a fixed release

Start the runtime:

```bash
make validate-release-config
docker compose --env-file .env.release -f compose.release.yml up -d
```

Then open:

- Web UI: `SKILLHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` 对应的地址
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8080`

Stop it with:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.release -f compose.release.yml down
```

The runtime stack uses its own Compose project name, so it does not
collide with containers from `make dev-all`.

The production Compose stack now defaults to the `docker` profile only.
It does not enable local mock auth. The release template (`.env.release.example`)
enables the bootstrap admin by default, so zero-config quickstart via
`runtime.sh` works out of the box:

- username: `admin`
- password: `ChangeMe!2026`

Recommended production baseline:

- set `SKILLHUB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the final HTTPS entrypoint
- keep PostgreSQL bound to `127.0.0.1` when exposing it locally
- change `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a strong password (`validate-release-config.sh` rejects the default `ChangeMe!2026`)
- rotate or disable the bootstrap admin after initial setup
- run `make validate-release-config` before `docker compose up -d`

If the GHCR package remains private, run `docker login ghcr.io` before
`docker compose up -d`.

### Upload Allowlist Override

If you need to replace the default upload allowlist at runtime, set:

```bash
SKILLHUB_PUBLISH_ALLOWED_FILE_EXTENSIONS=.md,.json,.xsd,.xsl,.dtd,.docx,.xlsx,.pptx
```

When set, it replaces the default allowlist instead of appending to it.

## Smoke Test

A lightweight smoke test script is available at [`scripts/smoke-test.sh`](./scripts/smoke-test.sh).

Run it against a local backend:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-test.sh http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage with Agent Platforms

SkillHub works as a skill registry backend for several agent platforms. Point any of the clients below at your SkillHub instance to publish, discover, and install skills.

### [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an open-source agent skill CLI. Configure it to use your SkillHub endpoint as the registry:

```bash
# Configure registry URL
export CLAWHUB_REGISTRY=https://skillhub.your-company.com

# Authenticate once if needed
clawhub login --token YOUR_API_TOKEN

# Search and install skills
npx clawhub search email
npx clawhub install my-skill
npx clawhub install my-namespace--my-skill

# Publish a skill
npx clawhub publish ./my-skill
```

> 💡 **Tip**: The above commands are not only applicable to OpenClaw, but also to other CLI Coding Agents or Agent assistants by specifying the installation directory (`--dir`). For example: `npx clawhub --dir ~/.claude/skills install my-skill`
